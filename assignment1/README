To run a backpropagation with cross-entropy error function for 1-layer neural network with SGD implementation, 
	cd code; python train.py # here parameters are tuned to its best setting

To run a backpropagation with cross-entropy error function for 2-layer network with SGD implementation,
	cd code; python train.py -hidden_layer_2_dimension 100

To run a minibatch of 32 with batch normalization, 
	cd code; python train.py -minibatch_size 32 -batch_normalization True
