To run a backpropagation with cross-entropy error function for 1-layer neural network with SGD implementation, 
	cd code; python train.py # here parameters are not tuned to its best setting. 

Our better models are achieved out of 6i) especially batch normalization with tanh? 

To run a backpropagation with cross-entropy error function for 2-layer network with SGD implementation,
	cd code; python train.py -hidden_layer_2_dimension 100

To run a good minibatch of 32 with batch normalization, 
	cd code; python train.py -minibatch_size 32 -batch_normalization True -activation tanh -lr 0.1

For more commands on 6 a) - i) questions,:
